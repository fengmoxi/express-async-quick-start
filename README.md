# express-async-quick-start
> A bare minimum project structure to get started developing with [`express`](http://www.expressjs.com.cn).

## Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/fengmoxi/express-async-quick-start.git MyProject
cd MyProject
rm -rf .git
git init

# install dependencies
yarn
```
